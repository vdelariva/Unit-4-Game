# Unit-4-Game

Unit 4 Game is another simple guessing game. The purpose of this assignment was to create a game using Javascript.

**How to Play:**

The purpose of the game is to match the random computer generated score. Each gem displayed has been assigned a random gem size from 1 - 12 carats. The computer generated score will have a value between 19 - 120 carats.

Select a gem to add its gem size to the running score. Take note how many carats each gem contributes. By selecting the different gems try to match the target score. You win when you match the target score. You lose if you exceed the score.

After each round, the game will reset and display a new random target score, each gem will be assigned a new gem size.

**Side notes:**

Spent more time on this assignment adding styling to the game. Used .fadeIn/.fadeOut functions to display the game status. If I were to spend more time on this assignment, I would not display the new random score at the end of the game while the 'You Win/Lose' status is being displayed. Also I would like to incorporate more fun styling such as 'sparkles' as described at https://codepen.io/simeydotme/pen/jgcvi. I think all websites should have sparkles ;)
